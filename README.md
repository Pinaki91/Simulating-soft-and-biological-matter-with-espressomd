# Simulating-soft-and-biological-matter-with-espressomd
The tutoroals use espresso-3.3.1 version to perform coarse-grained molecular dynamics.
Espresso can be downloaded from here, http://espressomd.org/wordpress/
Please cite the original article if you use the programs for researchs, Limbach, H.J., Arnold, A., Mann, B.A. and Holm, C., 2006.
ESPResSoâ€”an extensible simulation package for research on soft matter systems. Computer Physics Communications, 174(9), pp.704-727.

Steps to run the programs
1. Install espresso
2. Download the codes, save the functions.tcl and program file (e.g. lj_tutorial.tcl) in the same folder (e.g. test).
3. Execute the program from the terminal by
   /path-to-espresso-directory/./Espresso /test/lj_tutorial.tcl
   
However, running the programs successfully does not guarentee that the results are physically meaningful.
